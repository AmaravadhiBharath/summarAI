## EPISODE 1: "The 3AM Problem"
**Duration:** 60 seconds  
**Hook:** Relatable pain point that every AI user has experienced

### SCRIPT

**VISUAL:** Dark room, laptop screen glowing, clock showing 3:47 AM

**VOICEOVER:**

*"It's 3 AM. You've been working with ChatGPT for 6 hours straight."*

**VISUAL:** Screen recording showing a massive ChatGPT conversation (300+ messages)

*"You've built something incredible. Iterated. Refined. Perfected."*

**VISUAL:** User scrolling frantically through the conversation

*"And then your teammate Slacks you:"*

**TEXT MESSAGE OVERLAY:** *"Hey, what did you build? Can you send me a summary?"*

**VISUAL:** User's face - panic

*"And you realize... you have absolutely no idea."*

**VISUAL:** Split screen showing:
- Left: Messy conversation with contradictions
  - "Add a blue button"
  - "Make it red"
  - "Add 3 more buttons"
  - "Remove 2 buttons"
  - "Make them green"
- Right: User trying to manually count and summarize

**VOICEOVER:**

*"You'd have to read through 300 messages. Mentally calculate every change. Every contradiction. Every iteration."*

**VISUAL:** User closes laptop in frustration

*"There has to be a better way."*

### CLIFFHANGER HOOK

**VISUAL:** Screen goes black, then text appears:

```
What if AI could remember what you actually built?

Not what you asked for.
What you ACTUALLY built.

Episode 2: The Math Problem AI Can't Solve
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Next time: I'll show you the one thing ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude all get wrong. And it's embarrassingly simple."*

**END CARD:** "Follow for Episode 2 tomorrow"

## EPISODE 2: "The Math Problem AI Can't Solve"
**Duration:** 75 seconds  
**Hook:** Expose a fundamental flaw in current AI systems

### SCRIPT

**VISUAL:** Text appearing on screen

**TEXT:** *"Let's play a game. I'm going to ask ChatGPT a simple question."*

**VISUAL:** ChatGPT interface

**USER TYPES:** 
```
I want you to remember these instructions:
1. Add 3 mangoes to the basket
2. Remove 1 mango from the basket
3. Add 2 more mangoes
4. Remove 3 mangoes

How many mangoes are in the basket?
```

**CHATGPT RESPONSE:**
```
Let me calculate:
- Start: 0
- Add 3: 3 mangoes
- Remove 1: 2 mangoes
- Add 2: 4 mangoes
- Remove 3: 1 mango

Final answer: 1 mango in the basket.
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Okay, ChatGPT got it right. But now watch this."*

**VISUAL:** New ChatGPT conversation

**USER TYPES:**
```
Summarize our conversation.
```

**CHATGPT RESPONSE:**
```
You asked me to:
1. Add 3 mangoes to the basket
2. Remove 1 mango from the basket
3. Add 2 more mangoes
4. Remove 3 mangoes

And I calculated that there is 1 mango in the basket.
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"See the problem? ChatGPT can calculate the answer. But it can't compress the instructions."*

**VISUAL:** Side-by-side comparison:

**What you need:**
```
"Add 1 mango to the basket"
```

**What ChatGPT gives you:**
```
"Add 3 mangoes, remove 1, add 2, remove 3"
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"This is called the 'Net Effect Problem.' And it's why you can't summarize your AI conversations."*

**VISUAL:** Real example - code review conversation

**VISUAL:** Scrolling through a developer's ChatGPT conversation:
- "Add error handling to the login function"
- "Remove the error handling, use try-catch instead"
- "Add logging to the error handler"
- "Remove logging, use Sentry instead"
- "Add rate limiting"
- "Remove rate limiting, use middleware instead"

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Now imagine this, but with 300 messages. About code. About design. About product specs."*

**VISUAL:** Developer looking exhausted

*"You can't ask ChatGPT to summarize it. Because it'll just repeat everything you said."*

### CLIFFHANGER HOOK

**VISUAL:** Screen goes black, then text appears:

```
So how do you solve this?

How do you teach AI to understand NET EFFECT?

Episode 3: The Algorithm That Changes Everything
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Next time: I'll show you the algorithm we built. And why it's not just compression—it's intelligence."*

**END CARD:** "Follow for Episode 3 tomorrow"

---

## EPISODE 3: "The Algorithm That Changes Everything"
**Duration:** 90 seconds  
**Hook:** Reveal the technical solution (the "secret sauce")

### SCRIPT

**VISUAL:** Code editor opening

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Alright, let's talk about how we actually solved this."*

**VISUAL:** Whiteboard animation

**TEXT:** "The Net Effect Algorithm"

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Here's the problem: AI sees conversations as a list of messages. Message 1, Message 2, Message 3."*

**VISUAL:** Animation showing:
```
Message 1: "Add feature A"
Message 2: "Remove feature A"
Message 3: "Add feature B"
```

*"But humans don't think in lists. We think in states. We think in outcomes."*

**VISUAL:** Animation transforming the list into:
```
Final State: "Add feature B"
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"So we built an algorithm that does three things:"*

### STEP 1: ARITHMETIC LOGIC

**VISUAL:** Math equation appearing:

```
Add 3 - Remove 1 + Add 2 - Remove 3 = Add 1
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"First, it applies arithmetic logic. If you said 'Add 3' then 'Remove 1,' the net effect is 'Add 2.' Simple math."*

### STEP 2: CONTRADICTION ELIMINATION

**VISUAL:** Animation showing:
```
"Make the button blue"
"Make the button red"
"Make the button green"
```

**VISUAL:** Lines crossing out the first two, highlighting the last

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Second, it eliminates contradictions. If you changed your mind three times, only the final decision matters."*

### STEP 3: INTENT EXTRACTION

**VISUAL:** Real ChatGPT conversation appearing:
```
User: "Write a story about a dog"
User: "Add 3 mangoes to the story"
User: "Remove 1 mango"
User: "Make the dog a cat"
User: "Actually, keep it a dog"
```

**VISUAL:** Algorithm processing, then output appearing:

```
OUTPUT: "A story about a dog that includes 
two mangoes as narrative elements."
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Third, it extracts your final intent. Not what you asked for. What you actually wanted."*

**VISUAL:** Split screen showing before/after:

**Before (300 messages):**
```
[Scrolling through massive conversation]
```

**After (Tiger summary):**
```
"A React component for a user profile card 
with avatar, name, bio, and follow button. 
Uses Tailwind CSS with hover animations."
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"And it does this in under 3 seconds."*

### CLIFFHANGER HOOK

**VISUAL:** Screen goes black, then text appears:

```
But here's the thing...

This isn't just a summarizer.

It's a data transformer.

Episode 4: The Format That Changes Everything
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Next time: I'll show you why structured output is the real game-changer. And how it turns AI conversations into actual software."*

**END CARD:** "Follow for Episode 4 tomorrow"

---

## EPISODE 4: "The Format That Changes Everything"
**Duration:** 85 seconds  
**Hook:** Show the practical application (JSON/XML exports)

### SCRIPT

**VISUAL:** Tiger extension interface

*"Well, here's where it gets interesting."*

**VISUAL:** Format dropdown showing: TXT, JSON, XML

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Tiger doesn't just give you a text summary. It gives you structured data."*

### USE CASE 1: DEVELOPER WORKFLOW

**VISUAL:** ChatGPT conversation about a code review

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Let's say you're doing a code review with ChatGPT. You ask it to check your React component."*

**VISUAL:** Long conversation with multiple iterations

*"You go back and forth 50 times. Fixing bugs. Refactoring. Optimizing."*

**VISUAL:** Click "Generate Summary" → Select "JSON"

**VISUAL:** JSON output appearing:

```json
{
  "task": "Code review for UserProfile component",
  "final_recommendations": [
    "Add PropTypes validation",
    "Implement error boundary",
    "Use React.memo for optimization"
  ],
  "changes_made": [
    "Refactored useState to useReducer",
    "Added loading state handling",
    "Implemented accessibility attributes"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Write unit tests",
    "Add Storybook documentation"
  ]
}
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Now you have machine-readable data. You can pipe this directly into Jira. Into your docs. Into your CI/CD pipeline."*

### USE CASE 2: PRODUCT MANAGEMENT

**VISUAL:** Product manager with Gemini conversation

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Or let's say you're a PM spec'ing out a feature with Gemini."*

**VISUAL:** Massive conversation (500+ messages)

*"You've been iterating for days. Talking to stakeholders. Changing requirements."*

**VISUAL:** Click "Generate Summary" → Select "XML"

**VISUAL:** XML output appearing:

```xml
<feature>
  <name>User Authentication System</name>
  <target_audience>Enterprise customers</target_audience>
  <requirements>
    <requirement priority="high">SSO integration</requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">2FA support</requirement>
    <requirement priority="medium">Social login</requirement>
  </requirements>
  <timeline>Q1 2025</timeline>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>Auth0 integration</dependency>
    <dependency>Security audit</dependency>
  </dependencies>
</feature>
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Now your engineering team has a structured spec. No ambiguity. No back-and-forth."*

### THE BIGGER PICTURE

**VISUAL:** Diagram showing:
```
AI Conversation → Tiger → Structured Data → Your Tools
                                          ↓
                              Jira / Notion / GitHub / Slack
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"This isn't just about saving time. It's about turning AI conversations into actual software infrastructure."*

**VISUAL:** Code snippet showing API integration:

```javascript
const summary = await tiger.generateSummary({
  format: 'json',
  includeResponses: true
});

await jira.createTicket(summary);
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"You can automate this. Build it into your workflows. Make it part of your stack."*

### CLIFFHANGER HOOK

**VISUAL:** Screen goes black, then text appears:

```
But wait.

If this is so powerful...

Why hasn't anyone built it before?

Episode 5: The Technical Nightmare We Solved
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Next time: I'll show you why this was nearly impossible to build. And the three technical challenges that almost killed this project."*

**END CARD:** "Follow for Episode 5 tomorrow"

---

## EPISODE 5: "The Technical Nightmare We Solved"
**Duration:** 90 seconds  
**Hook:** Behind-the-scenes technical deep dive + final CTA

### SCRIPT

**VISUAL:** Dramatic music, code scrolling

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Alright, final episode. Let's talk about why this was a nightmare to build."*

### CHALLENGE 1: MANIFEST V3

**VISUAL:** Chrome Web Store rejection notice

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Challenge number one: Manifest V3."*

**VISUAL:** Code comparison:

**Old way (Manifest V2):**
```javascript
// Easy, but insecure
chrome.tabs.executeScript({
  code: 'document.body.innerHTML'
});
```

**New way (Manifest V3):**
```javascript
// Secure, but complex
chrome.scripting.executeScript({
  target: { tabId: tab.id },
  func: () => {
    // No remote code allowed
    // Everything must be bundled
    // Service workers only
  }
});
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Google forced everyone to Manifest V3. No remote code. No eval. Everything sandboxed."*

*"Most extensions broke. We had to rebuild from scratch."*

### CHALLENGE 2: SECURITY

**VISUAL:** Hacker icon, API key being stolen

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Challenge number two: API key security."*

**VISUAL:** Diagram showing:

**Bad approach:**
```
Extension → OpenAI API
(API key exposed in client code)
❌ Hackers steal your key
❌ Drain your bank account
```

**Good approach:**
```
Extension → Cloudflare Worker → OpenAI API
(API key stored in secure environment)
✅ Key never touches client
✅ Sub-100ms latency
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"We couldn't put the API key in the extension. So we built a serverless proxy with Cloudflare Workers."*

*"Your key stays secure. Latency stays under 100 milliseconds."*

### CHALLENGE 3: CROSS-PLATFORM SCRAPING

**VISUAL:** Logos of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity

**VOICEOVER:**

*"Challenge number three: Every AI platform has different HTML."*

**VISUAL:** Code showing different DOM structures:

```javascript
// ChatGPT
document.querySelectorAll('[data-message-author-role]')

// Gemini  
document.querySelectorAll('.model-response-text')

// Claude
document.querySelectorAll('[data-testid="user-message"]')
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"We had to build custom scrapers for each platform. And they keep changing their code."*

*"We're constantly updating. Constantly adapting."*

### THE RESULT

**VISUAL:** Tiger extension in action - smooth, fast, beautiful

**VOICEOVER:**

*"But we did it."*

**VISUAL:** Feature checklist appearing:

```
✅ Manifest V3 compliant
✅ Secure API proxy
✅ Cross-platform support
✅ Sub-100ms latency
✅ JSON/XML export
✅ Net effect algorithm
```

**VOICEOVER:**

*"A Chrome extension that actually understands what you built."*
